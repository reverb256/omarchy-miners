"""Poll every fleet miner and print one display-ready JSON record.

The shell panel does no discovery and no flattening of its own: this script
emits a flat `miners` list, per-host rollups, and fleet totals, so the QML
delegates bind straight to it.

Unit names are DATA, not derived. Each host owns its own naming:

  zephyr  Omarchy, units hand-managed in /etc/systemd/system
          -> peakminer-3060ti.service, peakminer-3090.service
  nexus   NixOS, services.peakminer instances
  forge   NixOS, services.peakminer instances
          -> peakminer-<instance-name>.service

Deriving a unit from the API port (the previous behaviour) matched no unit on
any host, so every pause silently did nothing. Keep these strings in step with
the hosts themselves, and never guess them from a port.
